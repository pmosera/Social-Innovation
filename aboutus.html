    <div class="LSE">
      <p> LSE is a world-renowned research institution, and the caliber of its students reflects this. By including ‘entrepreneurship’ in the course title and placing the programme in the Department of Management, the university has drawn a cohort of practically-minded, socially oriented and experienced students who want to go beyond the theoretical curriculum. As all self-proclaimed entrepreneurs do, we ventured to fill the gaps ourselves. In the words of Mark Twain, “I will never let school interfere with my education”. The creation of the society is part of a collective effort to supplement classroom learning with practical action.
